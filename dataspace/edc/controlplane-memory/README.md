# Catena-X Knowledge Agents (Hey Catena!) EDC Agent Plane

This folder hosts the [Http Protocols Aware Control Plane for the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC)](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector).

## Architecture

The Control Plane is a variant/extension to the In Memory Plane which
- supports routing synchronous sub-protocols of Http through attached data planes
- supports multiple endpoint receiver callbacks in its configuration

### Security

The mechanism for support sub-protocols is implemented by introducing an additional field "protocol" in the
proxy references (standard: HttpData) which corresponds to the type of the data address (and hence the type of DataSource 
to use on provider side). Using that field, also the consumer data plane can find an appropriate Datasource proxy implementation.

## Building

You could invoke the following command to compile and test the EDC Control extensions

```console
mvn -s ../../../settings.xml install
```

## Deployment & Usage

### Containerizing 

You could invoke the following command to compile and test the EDC Agent extensions

```console
mvn -s ../../../settings.xml install -Pwith-docker-image
```

Alternatively, the docker image of the http protocol aware control plane is built using

```console
docker build -t ghcr.io/catenax-ng/product-knowledge/control-plane-memory:latest -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile .
```

The image contains
* an EDC Control Plane with in memory stores.

To run the docker image, you could invoke this command

```console
docker run -p 8082:8082 \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/controlplane.properties:/app/configuration.properties \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/opentelemetry.properties:/app/opentelemetry.properties \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/logging.properties:/app/logging.properties \
  ghcr.io/catenax-ng/product-knowledge/control-plane-memory:latest
````

Afterwards, you should be able to access the [data management api](http://localhost:8082/data) via

For a list of environment variables to configure the behaviour of the data plane, we refer to [the EDC documentation](https://github.com/catenax-ng/product-edc).

The following is a list of configuraton objects and properties that you might set in the corresponding mounted config files
